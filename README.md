General Information

The game is played in a 25*55 game field including walls. There are two competitors: Player (P) and Computer (X). There are some treasures/numbers in the game, which the player collects to increase his/her score. The aim of the game is gaining the highest score.

Game Playing Information
 
The player can move over empty or earth squares, and can collect a treasure item when he/she reaches to the treasureâ€™s square. Robots can move randomly in empty squares, and cannot take treasures. Movements are in 4 directions (no diagonal movement). There cannot be more than one game element on the same square. Game elements which cannot take or harm each other, behave like walls when they encounter.

Game speed is 10 frames per second for all movements (player moves, robot moves, boulder falls for one square). When a falling boulder or computer robot reaches the player, game is over. If a boulder falls on a robot; robot disappears, player gains 900 score points.
 
When the player reaches a treasure's square, he/she places the number (1, 2, or 3) into the backpack. If the backpack is full, the element on the top is removed and the new taken element is inserted. At the top of the backpack, if two 
elements are identical numbers, they turn into score and teleport rights.
